## Category 1: Price / Cost Objections

### "This is too expensive for a project like this"
**Acknowledge**: "I appreciate you being direct about the investment concern."
**Clarify**: "When you say too expensive — is it the total, the rate, or the ROI that doesn't feel right?"
**Evidence options**:
- **Reframe to cost of inaction**: "Based on what you shared, the current situation costs you roughly $X/month in [delayed features / manual processes / downtime]. This engagement pays for itself in Y months."
- **Break down per deliverable**: "When you look at it per phase, Phase 0 is only $X for a comprehensive assessment that gives you a clear roadmap — even if you decide to execute internally."
- **Compare to alternatives**: "A comparable engagement with [Big4] would typically run 2-3x this investment. A full-time senior hire with this expertise costs $X/year fully loaded."

### "Can you lower the rate?"
**Acknowledge**: "I understand rate sensitivity. We want to make sure the economics work for you."
**Clarify**: "Is it the blended rate, or is there a specific role that feels misaligned?"
**Evidence options**:
- **Trade, don't discount**: "We can adjust the rate if we extend the commitment to 6 months — that gives us planning certainty. Would that work?"
- **Adjust team mix**: "We could bring in a mid-level resource for some of the implementation work, which would lower the blended rate to $X. The senior architect would still lead the design."
- **Scope adjustment**: "At a lower rate point, we'd need to reduce scope. Which phases are highest priority for you?"

### "Big4 quoted us less"
**Acknowledge**: "That's worth understanding. Different firms structure proposals differently."
**Clarify**: "Can you share more about what their proposal includes? Often the scope and team composition differ significantly."
**Evidence options**:
- **Staff model difference**: "Big4 typically staff with 60-70% junior consultants. Our team is majority senior, which means faster delivery and fewer mistakes to fix."
- **Hidden costs**: "Check for travel expenses, offshore coordination overhead, and project management fees — those often add 20-30% to the quoted price."
- **Outcome focus**: "We're happy to be evaluated on delivery outcomes. Our track record shows [specific metric]. We'd welcome a pilot comparison."

### "We don't have budget this year"
**Acknowledge**: "Budget cycles are real constraints. Let's see if there's a way to make this work."
**Clarify**: "Is it a timing issue (budget available next quarter) or a structural one (this wasn't planned)?"
**Evidence options**:
- **Phase it**: "What if we start with Phase 0 this year ($X) and plan the main delivery for Q1 when new budget is available?"
- **Different budget**: "Sometimes this falls under IT capex, R&D, or even a specific business unit. Is there a different budget owner who might have allocation?"
- **Cost justification**: "We can help you build the business case for budget approval. The ROI analysis from our assessment would support that."

## Category 2: Internal Team Objections

### "Why can't our team do this?"
**Acknowledge**: "You have a talented team — that's clear from our conversations."
**Clarify**: "Is the question about capability or capacity?"
**Evidence options**:
- **Capacity argument**: "Your team can absolutely do this work. The question is: should they? Pulling 3 senior developers off feature delivery for 3 months has its own cost — roughly $X in deferred roadmap items."
- **Expertise argument**: "For [specific area like microservices migration], our team has done this 15+ times. That pattern recognition means we avoid the common pitfalls that add 40-60% to first-time efforts."
- **Speed argument**: "We estimate 3 months with our experienced team. First-time internal effort typically takes 6-9 months. What's the business value of that 3-6 month acceleration?"
- **Knowledge transfer**: "We're not here to replace your team — we're here to accelerate them. Every phase includes knowledge transfer so your team owns the result."

### "We want to build internal capability, not depend on consultants"
**Acknowledge**: "That's exactly the right long-term strategy. We fully support that."
**Clarify**: "Are you looking to never use external help, or to use it strategically to jumpstart capabilities?"
**Evidence options**:
- **Enablement framing**: "Our engagement model is specifically designed for capability transfer. We embed with your team, pair-program, and document everything. By Phase 3, your team is leading and we're coaching."
- **Time-to-capability**: "Building this capability internally from scratch typically takes 12-18 months of hiring and learning. We can compress that to 3-4 months of working alongside your team."

## Category 3: Competition Objections

### "Why you versus [Big4 / Accenture / Deloitte]?"
**Evidence options**:
- **Senior talent**: "Our team members are the people who would be leading your engagement, not managing it from a distance. You get principal-level architects writing code, not reviewing it."
- **Agility**: "We can start next week with the right team. Larger firms typically have 4-6 week mobilization cycles."
- **Value/rate**: "Our rates reflect our overhead structure — lean, focused, no layers of management. You pay for delivery, not org chart."
- **Accountability**: "With us, you have a direct line to the people doing the work and the partners making decisions. No account manager buffer."

### "Why you versus [cheaper / offshore firm]?"
**Evidence options**:
- **Total cost of ownership**: "Lower rates often mean 2-3x the hours due to communication overhead, timezone gaps, rework, and management burden on your team."
- **Risk calculus**: "For strategic work like [their project], the cost of getting it wrong significantly exceeds the savings on rates. We've been brought in to fix offshore engagements — the rework cost is typically 150% of the original."
- **Engagement model**: "We work in your timezone, embed with your team, and iterate daily. That velocity and alignment is hard to replicate with distributed teams."

## Category 4: Timing Objections

### "Not the right time / Let's revisit next quarter"
**Acknowledge**: "Timing matters. Let's make sure we're aligned on the best moment to start."
**Clarify**: "What would need to change for the timing to be right? Is there a specific event or milestone you're waiting for?"
**Evidence options**:
- **Cost of delay**: "Every month of delay means $X in [continued technical debt / manual costs / competitive risk]. By Q2, the cost of waiting will have exceeded the Phase 0 investment."
- **Incremental start**: "We don't need to go all-in now. A 2-week assessment would give you the data to make a fully informed decision by next quarter — and costs only $X."
- **Team availability**: "Our senior architect for this domain is available now but has a commitment starting in [date]. Delaying might mean a different team composition."

## Category 5: Risk Objections

### "What if it doesn't work?"
**Acknowledge**: "That's a fair concern, especially with an external partner."
**Evidence options**:
- **Phase 0 as risk mitigation**: "That's exactly why we start with Phase 0 — a low-investment assessment that validates the approach before committing to full delivery."
- **Success criteria**: "We define success criteria upfront, with measurable checkpoints at each phase. If we're off track at Phase 1, we course-correct or you can exit."
- **Track record**: "In our last X similar engagements, we've delivered [Y% on time / Z% client satisfaction]. Here's a reference you can speak with directly."
- **Contractual protection**: "We can structure the engagement with phase gates — each phase is a separate commitment. You only proceed to the next phase if the current one delivers value."

### "How do we know you have the right expertise?"
**Evidence options**:
- **Specific credentials**: "Our team for this engagement includes [specific experience directly relevant to their challenge]."
- **Case study**: "We recently completed a similar [project type] for [similar company in similar industry]. The results were [specific outcomes]."
- **Technical demonstration**: "We'd be happy to do a brief technical deep-dive or architecture review session so your technical team can assess our approach firsthand."
- **Reference call**: "We can connect you with [reference client] who had a very similar challenge. They can speak to the experience and outcomes directly."
