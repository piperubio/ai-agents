>
> We recently helped a {industry} company in a similar spot reduce their
> deployment cycle from weeks to days by restructuring their service

Body:
> Hi {First_Name},

> starting with models — they're starting with data quality and use-case
> economics.
>
> {Company}'s {recent initiative / hiring pattern / product move} suggests
> you're thinking about this seriously. Would a 15-minute conversation on

> Best,
> {Sender}

## A/B Testing Guidance

### What to Test (one variable at a time)

| Variable | Test on | Why |
|----------|---------|-----|
| Subject line | Touch 1 | Highest-impact variable for open rate |
| CTA phrasing | Touch 5 | Assessment offer wording affects conversion |
| Angle (pain vs. opportunity) | Touch 3 | Tests which framing resonates |
| Email length (short vs. detailed) | Touch 1 | Tests attention tolerance |

### What NOT to Test Simultaneously
- Never change subject AND body AND CTA in the same test — isolate one variable.
- Never test on Touches 2 (LinkedIn) or 7 (breakup) — too little volume for signal.

### Minimum Sample Sizes
- Minimum 30 sends per variant before drawing conclusions.
- Track: open rate (subject test), reply rate (body/CTA test), meeting-booked rate (CTA test).

### Variant Design
- **Variant A**: Pain-focused — address a likely challenge.
- **Variant B**: Opportunity-focused — highlight a potential gain.
- Keep everything else identical between variants.

## Response Handling Decision Tree

### Positive Reply
Action: Schedule a discovery call within 48 hours.
- Send a calendar link with 2–3 time options.
- Confirm the call is a no-pressure conversation, not a sales meeting.
- Prepare by re-reading prospect profile and updating `commercial-state.md`.

### Question or Information Request
Action: Answer the question directly + include a soft CTA.
- Provide the requested information immediately.
- End with: "Happy to discuss further — would a 15-minute call make sense?"
- Do NOT deflect questions to "get on a call to discuss."

### Objection (timing, budget, not interested)
Action: Acknowledge, address briefly, defer gracefully.
- "Completely understand — timing is everything."
- If budget: "Good to know. When does your next planning cycle start?"
- If not interested: "Appreciate the directness. Mind if I check back in 6 months?"
- Log objection type in `commercial-state.md`.

### No Response (sequence complete)
Action: Continue sequence as planned.
- Do NOT accelerate the sequence or add extra touches.
- After Touch 7 (breakup), move to nurture list (quarterly check-in).
- Log outcome in `commercial-state.md`.

### Unsubscribe / Do-Not-Contact Request
Action: Remove immediately. No exceptions.
- Remove from all outreach lists within 24 hours.
- Do NOT send a "sorry to see you go" email.
- Log removal in `commercial-state.md`.

## Timing Optimization

### Best Days by Channel

| Channel  | Best Days       | Avoid          |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Email    | Tuesday–Thursday | Monday AM, Friday PM |
| LinkedIn | Tuesday–Wednesday | Weekends       |
| Phone    | Wednesday–Thursday 10–11 AM local | Monday, Friday |

### Best Times (recipient's local time zone)

| Channel  | Optimal Window     | Secondary Window |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Email    | 7:30–9:00 AM      | 1:00–2:00 PM    |
| LinkedIn | 8:00–10:00 AM     | 5:00–6:00 PM    |
| Phone    | 10:00–11:30 AM    | 2:00–3:30 PM    |

### Spacing Rules
- Minimum 3 days between touches on the same channel.
- Minimum 2 days between touches on different channels.
- Never send more than 2 touches in the same week.
- Pause all outreach during major holidays and industry conference weeks.

## Do-Not-Do List

### Spam Triggers — Avoid in Subject Lines and Body
- ALL CAPS words (except acronyms like CTO, AI, ML).
- Excessive punctuation (!!!, ???).
- Spam phrases: "Act now", "Limited time", "Free money", "Click here", "Buy now", "No obligation", "Guaranteed".
- Misleading subject lines (e.g., "Re:" or "Fwd:" on a first touch).
- Image-heavy emails with little text.
- URL shorteners (use full URLs or no URLs).

### CAN-SPAM Compliance Basics
- Include sender's physical mailing address in email footer.
- Include a clear unsubscribe mechanism.
- Honor unsubscribe requests within 10 business days (aim for 24 hours).
- Subject line must not be deceptive.
- Clearly identify the message as an advertisement if it is one (consulting outreach is typically exempt if there is a prior business relationship, but err on the side of transparency).

### Professional Conduct
- Never email personal addresses — use business email only.
- Never contact the same person from multiple senders simultaneously.
- Never misrepresent your identity or firm.
- Never reference competitor weaknesses or disparage other firms.
- Never use tracking pixels without disclosure if legally required in the prospect's jurisdiction.
- Never send outreach from a no-reply address.
- Stop all outreach immediately if the prospect or their company requests it.
