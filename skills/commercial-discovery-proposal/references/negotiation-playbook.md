# Negotiation Playbook — Discovery Service

## Strategic Consulting + Software Development

---

## Central Principle

You do not negotiate price.

You negotiate clarity, priority, and commitment.

If that is well managed, price becomes a consequence.

---

## STAGE 1 — Economic Qualification (BEFORE Deep Work)

### Objective
Avoid designing without budget validation.

### What You Must Achieve
- Validated range.
- Decision-maker identified.
- Priority confirmed.

### Script

> "Before advancing to a deeper design stage, I want to validate that we are aligned on the order of magnitude.
>
> Similar projects have been between X and Y depending on complexity.
>
> Are we in a coherent range with what you have considered?"

Silence.

### If They Say "We don't know the budget"

> "I understand. Without a minimum range it is difficult to design responsibly. Can we at least define a probable scenario?"

**If they cannot -> Do not advance.**

---

## STAGE 2 — Selling the Discovery (Risk Reduction)

### Objective
Convert interest into initial investment.

**Here you do NOT sell development. You sell uncertainty reduction.**

### Script

> "To commit to real numbers we need to properly structure the solution.
>
> That stage has a duration of X weeks and an investment of Y."

Then add:

> "The result is an executable plan with refined estimation and implementation strategy."

### If They Object to the Price

Do not defend hours. Say:

> "What we are doing in this stage is preventing the project from having costly deviations later."

### Reframing the Decision

> "At this point the decision is not about the document.
>
> It is about whether you want to reduce the project's risk before executing it."

### Clarifying the Cost of Inaction

> "If we don't structure correctly now, the risk doesn't disappear.
>
> It only transfers to implementation, where the impact is more expensive."

### Reducing Financial Fear

If you notice economic hesitation:

> "I'd prefer we don't advance if this isn't within your current priorities.
>
> But if the project is strategic, this phase is precisely what prevents cost overruns later."

This transmits security. Not need. And security sells.

## STAGE 3 — Post-Discovery Negotiation (Real Number)

Now you have a refined estimation.

The typical mistake is presenting the number and waiting for a reaction.

Instead:

### Correct Presentation

1. Reconfirm the problem.
2. Reconfirm the priority.
3. Reconfirm the impact.
4. Then present the number.

Example:

> "To solve X, with Y scope and Z architecture, the estimated investment is $XXX."

Silence.

Do not justify immediately.

---

## STAGE 4 — Objection Handling

### Objection 1: "It's higher than expected"

> "Compared to what scenario?"

Force them to make expectations explicit. Then:

> "We can adjust scope or phases, but reducing cost without adjusting impact is not responsible."

**Never lower price without moving scope.**

### Objection 2: "We need to evaluate it"

> "Perfect. What criteria will you use to make the decision?"

This transforms evasion into a concrete process. Then:

> "Would it work for you if we schedule a review on day X to define next steps?"

**Without a date -> It's not active.**

### Objection 3: "Can you give us a discount?"

> "What if instead of a discount, we adjust the scope to match the budget you have in mind?"

Always trade scope for price. Never give price away.

---

## STAGE 5 — Closing

Never close with "I'll be waiting."

Close with:

> "Is there anything preventing you from moving forward today?"

If they say no -> Sign.

If they hesitate -> Now you know where the block is.

### Pre-Close Technique (Use in Previous Meetings)

> "If the investment range is aligned, is there anything else you need to move forward?"

If you don't ask this before, the final close is always uncertain.

> **For the complete closing flow (handling "we need to evaluate it", "it's expensive", silence),
> close/no-close signals, silence as deliberate technique, the Smart Clause (optional pricing lever),
> and the pre-close readiness checklist, see `discovery-closing-playbook.md`.**

## Key Questions Before the Real Close

1. "Is this project strategically approved or still under evaluation?"
2. "Who else participates in the decision?"
3. "What criteria will you use to decide on a vendor?"
4. "What would happen if this is delayed 6 months?"

That last one is powerful.

## Negotiation Control Checklist

For every opportunity, you must have:

- [ ] Budget validated
- [ ] Decision-maker present
- [ ] Priority >= 8/10
- [ ] Estimated start date
- [ ] Agreed decision date

**If one is missing, it is not ready for close.**

## Negotiation Mental Structure

| Phase | What You Really Negotiate |
|-------|--------------------------|
| Qualification | Priority |
| Discovery | Commitment |
| Implementation | Scope |
| Close | Decision |

You never negotiate technical value. You negotiate clarity and timing.

---

## Why Clients Disappear

When clients disappear, it is typically missing one of these:

- Real urgency.
- Strong sponsor.
- Early economic validation.
- Concrete decision date.

Negotiation does not fail at the end. It fails before.

---

## Important Principle

In strategic consulting, the close should not be a surprise.

If the client falls at the end, the problem was in early validation.

The close only formalizes something that was already emotionally decided.

---

## Advanced Technique: Budget Calibration

Your problem is that the number appears late.

Introduce this in the initial stage:

> "Just to align expectations, are we talking about a project that could be in the order of $X to $Y?"

This changes everything. It is not a quote. It is calibration.
