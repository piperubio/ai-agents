# Discovery Closing Playbook

## Strategic Consulting + Software Development

---

## Core Principle

If they will not invest in understanding the problem,
they will not invest in solving it.

This principle drives every decision in the Discovery sale.
A prospect who resists paying for structured understanding is signaling
that either the problem is not real, the urgency is not real, or the budget
is not real. All three are disqualification signals.

When you doubt charging for Discovery, the client doubts it too.
Conviction in the value of Discovery is non-negotiable.

---

## Positioning Directive

### What NOT to Say

> "The next step is to gather requirements."

This framing positions Discovery as a vendor-side task — operational,
administrative, something you do before the real work. It signals that
Discovery is free scoping, not a service.

### What to Say Instead

> "To make responsible decisions, we need to properly structure the solution.
> That is what we do in a Discovery engagement."

Then define clearly:
- Duration (2–4 weeks).
- Concrete deliverables.
- Tangible output.
- The level of certainty they will have at the end.

### Why This Framing Matters

"Gathering requirements" sounds like something an intern does.
"Structuring the solution responsibly" sounds like what a senior partner
at a strategy firm charges $40,000 for.

The language you use before the price signals the value of what you are selling.
If you frame it operationally, the client negotiates on hours.
If you frame it strategically, the client decides based on risk and value.

---

## Presentation Structure

Use this 4-step sequence when presenting Discovery to a prospect.
Follow this order — do not skip steps and do not reorder.

### Step 1 — The Problem (Current Reality)

State the problem back to the prospect in their own words.
Connect it to business impact.

> "Based on what you described, the core challenge is [X].
> This is generating [Y impact] and has been difficult to solve because [Z reason]."

This signals you listened. It also re-anchors the conversation on pain
before you introduce an investment.

### Step 2 — The Risk of Proceeding Without Clarity

Make the cost of skipping Discovery explicit.

> "If we move directly to a proposal from here, the number we give you
> would be speculative. The risk would be absorbed by you — through scope creep,
> change orders, or building the wrong thing."

Reinforce:

> "The question is not whether uncertainty exists.
> It is who carries it — and at what point in the project."

### Step 3 — The Benefit of Discovery

Explain what Discovery produces, not what it costs.

> "The Discovery gives us the information we need to design the right solution
> and give you a precise, defensible estimate — not a guess.
>
> At the end, you have a complete implementation plan you can execute with us
> or with any other vendor."

Key point to communicate: the deliverable belongs to them.
It is not locked to proceeding with us.

### Step 4 — The Investment

State the price clearly and directly.

> "The investment for this stage is X."

Then: silence.

Do not justify immediately.
Do not elaborate on what is included.
Do not fill the silence.

The silence is doing work. Let it.

If they ask questions after the silence, answer them.
If they object, move to the objection handling section.
The instinct to talk after stating the price is the single most common
mistake in closing Discovery. It signals insecurity and invites negotiation.

---

## Objection Handling

The following three objections are specific to the Discovery sale.
For general negotiation objections (price vs. scope, discount requests,
competitive comparisons), see `negotiation-playbook.md`.

---

### Objection 1: "Why do I have to pay for you to give me a quote?"

This is the most common objection and the most important to answer correctly.

**Do NOT say**: "It's because we need to understand your requirements."
(That frames Discovery as your problem, not their value.)

**Response**:

> "Because we are not quoting hours — we are designing the solution.
>
> Without this stage, we would be improvising. And when consultants improvise
> on scope, the client pays for it in the implementation phase."

**Reframe**:

> "The Discovery is precisely what prevents cost overruns later.
> It is not a prerequisite we are imposing — it is a risk management tool
> you are buying."

**If they push further**:

> "Think of it this way: if you were building a house, you would not ask the
> architect to hand you a fixed price before seeing the land, the permit
> conditions, or what you want to build. The architectural plan is not a
> formality — it is what makes everything else reliable."

---

### Objection 2: "What if we don't end up doing the project with you?"

This objection is actually a buying signal — they are mentally projecting
forward into an implementation. Handle it with directness, not defensiveness.

**Response**:

> "The deliverable is yours, regardless of what happens next.
>
> You get a complete implementation plan — architecture, roadmap, refined
> estimation, risk register. You can use it with us or take it to any other
> vendor. That is intentional."

**Why this matters**:

> "We design the Discovery to give you maximum independence.
> If you choose us for implementation, it is because the Discovery demonstrated
> we are the right partner — not because we locked you in."

**Effect**: This response increases perceived professionalism and reduces
the sense of commercial pressure. Paradoxically, clients who feel free to
leave are more likely to stay.

---

### Objection 3: "We don't have a defined budget yet"

This objection requires diagnosis before responding. There are two versions:

**Version A**: They genuinely have not defined a budget and Discovery would
help them do it. This is a valid situation.

**Version B**: They are using "no budget" as a polite exit. If there is no
urgency and no decision-maker in the conversation, this is likely Version B.

**Response for Version A**:

> "That is exactly what the Discovery helps define precisely.
>
> What we need to validate first is whether the order of magnitude of the
> project is viable for you. If we are talking about a project in the range
> of X to Y, is that consistent with the investment you could consider?"

If they can validate the order of magnitude → proceed.
If they cannot or will not → this is a disqualification signal. See the
No-Close Signals section below.

**Response for Version B** (when you sense this is an exit):

> "I understand. Without a minimum range it is difficult to design
> responsibly — or for you to evaluate whether the investment makes sense.
>
> Would it make sense to revisit this conversation when the budget picture
> is clearer? I would rather pause here than advance a process that is
> premature for where you are right now."

This signals confidence. You are not chasing. If they want to continue,
they will clarify. If they do not, you have saved both parties' time.

---

## Silence as Deliberate Technique

Silence is one of the most underused tools in the Discovery sale.
Use it deliberately in three specific moments:

### Moment 1: After stating the investment amount

State the price. Stop talking. Do not add "...which covers X, Y, Z."
Do not say "I know that might sound like a lot but..."
Wait for the prospect to respond.

The prospect's first reaction after hearing the price is the most honest
signal you will get about their budget reality and urgency level.

### Moment 2: After the closing question

> "Is there anything preventing you from moving forward today?"

Ask it. Stop. Do not elaborate. Do not restate the question.
The discomfort of silence belongs to whoever speaks next.
If you speak first, you lose the information.

### Moment 3: After an objection response

You have just reframed their objection.
Pause. Let the reframe land.
If you immediately add more reasoning, you signal that you are not
confident the reframe was enough. That invites more objections.

---

## Close and No-Close Signals

### Signals the Discovery Will Close

Watch for these during and after the qualification meeting and proposal walkthrough:

- They ask technical questions about the methodology or approach.
- They ask about timelines and start dates.
- They ask about who on your team would be involved.
- They ask about next steps without being prompted.
- They introduce new stakeholders to the conversation ("you should talk to our CTO about this").
- They ask about what happens after Discovery (implementation conversation).
- They respond quickly to proposals and follow-up messages.
- They reference the Discovery in future conversations as "when we do the Discovery."

These signals indicate the client has mentally moved past the "whether" and
is now evaluating the "how." Accelerate toward close.

### Signals the Discovery Will NOT Close

Do not invest further resources if you observe these:

- The decision-maker is not present and access is being blocked.
- They have not validated even an order of magnitude for the budget.
- Urgency is below 7 out of 10 with no compelling event on the horizon.
- They say "we are looking at options" or "we are just exploring" after probing.
- They compare your Discovery price to a product subscription or offshore rate.
- Meeting follow-up takes more than 5 business days without explanation.
- They ask for the Discovery deliverables in the proposal but resist paying for them.
- They ask you to "start thinking" before the contract is signed.

If two or more of these are present: execute a professional cut.
Continuing the process consumes resources and trains the prospect that
your time has no cost.

---

## Closing Flow

### The Closing Question

Never close with:

> "I will be waiting to hear from you."

That is not a close. It is an invitation to postpone indefinitely.

Close with:

> "Is there anything preventing you from moving forward today?"

This question works because:
- If the answer is "no" → the path to signature is clear.
- If the answer reveals a specific blocker → now you know what to address.
- It forces a decision, rather than leaving the outcome open.

### Handling the Three Common Responses

**"We need to evaluate it internally"**

Do not accept this without a date.

> "Of course. When would it make sense to reconnect — would [specific date]
> work to define next steps?"

Without a concrete date, this is not an active opportunity.
Add it to the calendar before ending the meeting.

**"It's expensive"**

Do not defend the price. Ask a question instead.

> "Compared to what?"

This forces them to make their reference point explicit. Common reference
points:
- A cheaper vendor → address quality, risk, and true cost.
- Internal resources → address opportunity cost, speed, and expertise gap.
- Doing nothing → quantify the cost of the current problem persisting.

Then, if needed:

> "We can discuss scope. But reducing cost without adjusting what we deliver
> would not be responsible — and it would not solve the problem."

**Silence after the closing question**

Hold it. Do not fill the silence. Do not restate the question.
Do not add justification. Wait.

The first person to speak after the closing question has conceded
psychological ground. If it is the prospect, they will often answer
the objection themselves.

## The Smart Clause (Optional Negotiation Lever)

The Smart Clause is a pricing technique that reduces financial friction
when a qualified prospect shows genuine intent but hesitates on the
Discovery investment as a standalone cost.

**When to deploy**:
- Prospect is clearly qualified (P.U.D.T.F >= 22, urgency >= 7/10).
- Decision-maker is present and engaged.
- The hesitation is specifically financial — they see the value but the
  Discovery price feels like an additional cost on top of an already
  anticipated project budget.
- You have confirmed they intend to proceed to implementation if Discovery
  confirms the scope.

**When NOT to deploy**:
- Do not lead with it. Never open the Discovery conversation with this offer.
- Do not use it to close a poorly qualified opportunity.
- Do not use it if the prospect has not yet validated a budget range for
  the full project — the clause only makes sense if there is a project to
  integrate into.
- Do not deploy it as a discount. Frame it as a structural option, not a
  concession.

### Option A — Partial Integration (50%)

> "If we move forward to implementation after Discovery, we apply 50% of
> the Discovery investment toward the implementation engagement."

This reduces the net cost of Discovery while preserving its independent
value. The Discovery is still paid, still delivered, still fully theirs.

Use when: The prospect is price-sensitive but committed to the project.
Effect: Lowers the perceived risk of the Discovery investment without
eliminating it.

### Option B — Full Integration (Conditional)

> "If we execute the full project together, the Discovery investment is
> absorbed into the total project budget."

This positions Discovery as a strategic advance — not an additional cost,
but the first payment of the broader engagement.

Use when: The prospect has a firm project intent and the conversation is
already at "we want to work with you, but the two-step payment feels
cumbersome."

Effect: Removes the financial friction of a separate upfront payment.
Risk: Only use this if you are confident the implementation opportunity
will follow. If Discovery closes and they choose a different vendor,
you have delivered the Discovery at no charge.

### Guardrail

The Smart Clause does not change the commercial model.
Discovery is always a separate engagement with independent deliverables.
The clause is a pricing bridge — not a bundling of the services.

If a prospect asks "so the Discovery is free if we do the implementation?"
the correct response is:

> "No — the Discovery is a paid engagement regardless. What the clause does
> is apply the Discovery investment as a credit toward the implementation,
> so you are not paying for both separately. The Discovery deliverables
> are yours either way."

## Pre-Close Readiness Checklist

Before attempting the final close, confirm all of the following:

- [ ] The problem has been stated in the prospect's own words and confirmed.
- [ ] The cost of proceeding without Discovery has been made explicit.
- [ ] The deliverables and duration have been clearly defined.
- [ ] The investment amount has been presented and received (including silence).
- [ ] The decision-maker is present or has been briefed and is aligned.
- [ ] Budget range has been validated (order of magnitude confirmed).
- [ ] A decision date has been established or confirmed.
- [ ] The main objection (if any) has been addressed and acknowledged by the prospect.

**If any item is unchecked**: do not attempt the final close.
Address the gap first. A premature close that fails sets back the process
more than a well-timed close that succeeds.
