# Discovery Service Playbook

## Consulting Projects in Technology Solutions

---

## 1. Purpose

Establish a standard framework for:

- Addressing consulting projects where scope uncertainty is high.
- Reducing commercial and technical risk before committing to implementation.
- Defining clear advancement criteria between phases.
- Standardizing payment methods for discovery engagements.
- Protecting margin and strategic positioning.

This playbook applies to strategy, architecture, development, automation, data, cloud, and AI projects.

---

## 2. Guiding Principles

1. No deep strategic design work without a contract.
2. No building without scope clarity.
3. No absorbing uncertainty without economic compensation.
4. Each phase must reduce a specific type of risk.
5. Every phase has entry and exit criteria.

## 3. Phase Model

### PHASE 0 — Strategic Qualification (Pre-Sale, No Cost)

#### External Objective
Understand the client's problem and validate collaboration viability.

#### Internal Objective
Determine if the client meets minimum criteria to invest strategic time.

#### Scope
- Exploratory meeting.
- Problem identification.
- Decision-maker identification.
- Preliminary budget validation.
- Urgency validation.

#### Payment: None (no cost).

#### Continuity Criteria (Internal Checks)

- [ ] Decision-maker identified.
- [ ] Real urgency exists (not vague exploration).
- [ ] Budget or estimated range exists.
- [ ] Problem aligns with our capabilities.
- [ ] Client understands that the next phase is paid.

**If any check fails -> Do not advance.**

---

### PHASE 1 — Strategic Discovery (Solution Design) — THE PAID SERVICE

#### External Objective
Reduce conceptual and technical uncertainty.

#### Internal Objective
Convert an ambiguous problem into an executable plan with a defensible estimation.

#### Scope (Deliverables)
- Refined problem definition.
- Prioritized scope.
- High-level architecture.
- Risk identification.
- Roadmap.
- Estimation with reduced range (target: +/- 20%).
- Implementation strategy.

#### Exclusions
- Productive development.
- Full implementation.

#### Payment Method: Fixed price.

#### Continuity Criteria (Exit Checks)

- [ ] Scope defined and validated.
- [ ] Critical risks identified.
- [ ] Estimation with uncertainty margin <= +/- 20%.
- [ ] Client accepts estimation and implementation model.
- [ ] Formal approval to execute exists.

**If client does not confirm -> Project closes without structural loss.**

---

### PHASE 2 — Implementation (Separate Opportunity)

> **IMPORTANT**: Implementation is a SEPARATE commercial opportunity.
> After Discovery closes as won, a new opportunity is created for the implementation engagement.
> The client may choose a different vendor for implementation.

#### When Implementation Stays with Us
The Discovery deliverables become the primary input for solution-design and proposal-writing in the implementation opportunity, significantly reducing estimation uncertainty from +/- 30% to +/- 20% or better.

#### Payment Options (for the implementation opportunity)

**Option A — Time & Materials with budget cap**
- Monthly billing.
- Updated forecast.
- Review if deviation > X%.

**Option B — Fixed price by milestones**
- Payments linked to verifiable deliverables.

**Option C — Mixed model**
- Fixed base + hours pool for adjustments.

---

### PHASE 3 — Go-Live and Adoption (Part of Implementation)

#### Scope
- Deployment.
- Migration.
- Training.
- Post-launch adjustments.
- Stabilization.

#### Closure Criteria
- [ ] System operational in production environment.
- [ ] Client functional validation.
- [ ] Training completed.
- [ ] Documentation delivered.
- [ ] Closure act signed.

---

### PHASE 4 — Evolution (Optional, Part of Implementation)

#### Modalities
- Monthly retainer.
- Dedicated squad.
- Quarterly evolutionary roadmap.
- Evolutionary support.

---

## 4. Fundamental Commercial Rules

1. **Discovery is always paid.**
2. Never deliver implementable architecture without a contract.
3. Never absorb changes without a formal mechanism.
4. Always validate budget range before designing.
5. Every phase must have clear exit criteria.

---

## 5. Internal Health Indicators

- % of clients that advance from Phase 0 to Phase 1.
- % of Discoveries that convert to implementation.
- Average margin per phase.
- Non-billed hours per project.
- Average deviation between estimation and actual.

---

## 6. Early Warning Signs (Red Flags)

- Client avoids discussing budget.
- No clear decision-maker.
- "We just want a quick quote."
- Requests detailed architecture before contract.
- Does not formally validate scope.

**If 2 or more appear -> High risk.**

---

## 7. Internal Governance

Before advancing between phases, there must be:

- Brief internal review.
- Financial validation.
- Partner or responsible lead approval.
- Contractual confirmation.

## 8. Discovery Pricing Guidelines

### Sizing the Discovery

| Factor | Small | Medium | Large |
|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| Number of systems/domains | 1-2 | 3-5 | 6+ |
| Stakeholder groups | 1-2 | 3-4 | 5+ |
| Technical complexity | Low | Medium | High |
| Integration points | 0-2 | 3-5 | 6+ |
| Duration (weeks) | 2-3 | 3-5 | 5-8 |
| Typical effort (person-weeks) | 2-4 | 4-8 | 8-16 |

### What Determines Discovery Price
- Number and complexity of domains to investigate.
- Number of stakeholder interviews required.
- Depth of technical assessment needed.
- Level of architecture detail expected.
- Whether proof-of-concept or prototype is included.

### Discovery Deliverables Checklist
- [ ] Executive summary of findings
- [ ] Current state assessment
- [ ] Problem prioritization matrix
- [ ] High-level solution architecture
- [ ] Technology recommendations with rationale
- [ ] Phased implementation roadmap
- [ ] Effort estimation with reduced uncertainty (+/- 20%)
- [ ] Risk register
- [ ] Team composition recommendation
- [ ] Implementation strategy and engagement model recommendation
