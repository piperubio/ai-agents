Instructions:
1. Replace bracketed placeholders (e.g., [Project Name]) with real values.
2. Keep this file free of secrets; reference secure locations for credentials.
3. Update the plan version and last updated fields after revisions.

Variants:
1) Compact one-pager: reduce scope, risks and tables to produce a single-page summary.
2) Client-friendly version: add a cover page and a non-technical executive summary.

If you want I can also create a one-pager or a client-friendly variant now.
