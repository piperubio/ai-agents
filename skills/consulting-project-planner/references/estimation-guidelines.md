# Estimation Guidelines

Use these guidelines to convert discussions and scope into duration estimates and team sizing.

Project size categories

- Micro (Proof of concept): 1–2 weeks | 1–2 people | Low complexity
- Small (MVP): 1–2 months | 2–4 people | Medium complexity
- Medium (Product): 3–6 months | 4–8 people | Medium-High complexity
- Large (Platform): 6–12 months | 8+ people | High complexity

Adjustment factors (apply multiplicatively as needed)

- New technology stack: +30% time
- Unclear requirements: +50% time
- External dependencies: +20% time per critical external dependency
- Junior-heavy team: +40% time
- Regulatory or compliance requirements: +25% time

Task sizing guidance

- Target atomic tasks at 4–8 hours of focused work. If a task is larger, break it down.
- For cross-functional tasks, add coordination overhead (0.5–1 day per week per cross-functional sync).
- Use historical velocity where available; otherwise use relative sizing (S/M/L/XL) converted to hours.

Buffers and contingency

- Apply a baseline contingency of 15–25% depending on uncertainty.
- For high-risk projects with many unknowns, prefer the upper bound or increase contingency.

Estimation cadence

- Initial estimation: fast estimate (30–60 minutes) for planning and stakeholder alignment.
- Refinement: timeboxed estimation sessions with task owners before each major phase or sprint.
