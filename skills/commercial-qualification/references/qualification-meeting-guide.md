# Qualification Meeting Guide

## Purpose

This guide provides operational scripts, timing, and techniques for conducting
a **Qualification Meeting** (30-40 minutes) with a prospect. This meeting is
distinct from the Discovery Meeting (60 min): its goal is not to deeply explore
the problem, but to determine **go/no-go** and gather enough signal to produce
a reliable BANTTD scorecard.

The qualification meeting typically follows an initial exploratory call or
inbound lead. It is the first structured commercial interaction.

---

## P.U.D.T.F Pre-Filter

Before investing in a full BANTTD scoring session, run the P.U.D.T.F quick
check. This is an in-meeting operational filter — five dimensions each scored
1-5 by the agent after the meeting. If the total is below **22/30**, the
opportunity is unlikely to qualify and a "professional cut" should be executed
promptly.

| Dimension | Key Question | Score (1-5) |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **P — Problema** | Is there a specific, real, acknowledged problem? | |
| **U — Urgencia** | Is there urgency or a compelling event driving action? | |
| **D — Decisor** | Are we talking to someone with decision-making power or clear path to it? | |
| **T — Ticket** | Is there budget allocated or a realistic path to it? | |
| **F — Fecha** | Is there a defined decision date or timeline to act? | |
| **Total** | | **/30** |

**Cut score**: < 22 → execute Professional Cut protocol (see below).  
**Pass score**: >= 22 → proceed to full BANTTD scoring and schedule Discovery.

### P.U.D.T.F Scoring Guide (1-5 per dimension)

**P — Problema**
- 1: Problem does not exist or is not acknowledged ("just exploring")
- 2: Vague discomfort, not articulated as a real problem
- 3: Problem acknowledged but not well-defined or scoped
- 4: Specific problem with known business impact
- 5: Acute, quantified problem with urgency to solve it now

**U — Urgencia**
- 1: No urgency — "maybe someday"
- 2: Low urgency — "next year, when we get to it"
- 3: Moderate urgency — "this year, ideally Q3-Q4"
- 4: High urgency — "this quarter, internal pressure building"
- 5: Critical urgency — external deadline, regulatory, contractual, or board mandate

**D — Decisor**
- 1: No decision maker identified, no path upward
- 2: Mid-level contact, decision process unclear
- 3: Contact has influence, knows who decides, willing to make introduction
- 4: Champion is engaged, decision maker identified and accessible
- 5: We have direct access to the economic buyer

**T — Ticket**
- 1: No budget — "we'd need to find money"
- 2: Conceptual willingness to invest, no concrete budget
- 3: Budget exists but not allocated to this initiative
- 4: Budget range discussed, consistent with typical engagement size
- 5: Budget confirmed, allocated, and purchase process known

**F — Fecha de Decisión**
- 1: No decision date — "whenever it makes sense"
- 2: "Next fiscal year, probably"
- 3: "In the next 2-3 quarters" — imprecise but directional
- 4: "Within this quarter" — clear intent with approximate date
- 5: Specific date given, tied to a business event (launch, compliance, board review)

## Meeting Structure (30-40 min)

### Before the Meeting

Prepare:
- Review prospect profile and any prior interaction notes
- Pre-score P.U.D.T.F based on available information (to calibrate questions)
- Identify the one thing you need to confirm per dimension
- Have a "professional cut" script ready — you may need it

### Phase 1 — Opening (0-5 min)

**Goal**: Set a collaborative, honest tone. Frame the meeting as mutual evaluation.

> "Thanks for making time. Our goal for today is simple: I want to understand
> your situation well enough to know if there is a real fit between what you are
> working on and what we do well. And I want to be honest with you — if I do not
> think we are the right fit, I will tell you directly. That is more respectful
> of your time than dragging a process out. Sound good?"

> "I have set aside 35 minutes. I will ask you some focused questions, then
> you can ask us anything. Does that work?"

**Listen for**: How they respond to the mutual-evaluation framing. Resistance
signals they may not be a serious buyer.

---

### Phase 2 — Problem Validation (5-15 min)

**Goal**: Confirm the problem is real, specific, and acknowledged. Score **P** and **U**.

#### Problem questions

> "Tell me what is driving this conversation today. What specifically is not
> working?"

> "How long has this been a problem?"

> "What have you tried so far to fix it, internally or with other vendors?"

> "What happens if this does not get resolved in the next 6 months?"

#### Urgency calibration (1-10 scale)

Use an explicit scale to surface real urgency level:

> "On a scale of 1 to 10 — where 1 is 'this is nice to have, no rush' and 10
> is 'this is critical and we need to act this quarter' — where would you put
> this initiative today?"

**Interpretation**:
- **1-3**: Low urgency. The initiative will likely be deprioritized. Flag U = 1-2. Consider Professional Cut unless budget and authority are strong.
- **4-6**: Moderate urgency. Real problem but competing priorities. Flag U = 2-3. Ask what would move it up the scale.
- **7-8**: High urgency. Internal pressure. Score U = 4. Confirm there is a real driver.
- **9-10**: Critical. External or executive mandate. Score U = 5. Ask for the specific event or deadline.

**Follow-up for 4-7 range**:
> "What would need to change for this to become a 9 or 10?"

**Follow-up for 9-10**:
> "What is the event or deadline that makes this a 9? Is that date fixed or
> can it move?"

#### Red flags to watch
- Prospect describes the problem in very general or buzzword terms after probing ("we need digital transformation")
- Problem was "assigned" to them — they are not the one feeling the pain
- No failed past attempts (may indicate the problem is not severe enough to have tried solving)

---

### Phase 3 — Decision Maker Validation (15-22 min)

**Goal**: Map the buying committee. Confirm we can reach the economic buyer. Score **D**.

> "Help me understand how decisions like this get made in your organization.
> If you decided today that you wanted to move forward with an engagement like
> this, what would the approval process look like?"

> "Who ultimately signs off on something of this scope and investment level?"

> "And in this conversation today — where do you sit in that process?"

> "Is the person who approves the budget aware that you are evaluating options?"

> "How have you brought in external partners in the past — was it a formal
> procurement process, or more relationship-driven?"

**If they are not the decision maker**:
> "Would it make sense to include [name/role] in a next conversation, so we
> are not going back and forth and I can address their questions directly?"

**If they resist bringing in the decision maker**:
> "I want to make sure we use your time well. In my experience, the sooner
> we include the person who approves, the faster we can move — or the sooner
> we know if there is not a real fit. Does that make sense?"

**Decision maker scoring signals**:
- Score D = 5: Economic buyer is in the room, or confirmed meeting scheduled
- Score D = 4: Champion identified, willing to arrange introduction
- Score D = 3: Contact knows who decides, will try to facilitate
- Score D = 2: Vague about process, mid-level contact, no clear path
- Score D = 1: No visibility into decision process, junior contact

---

### Phase 4 — Budget Calibration (22-30 min)

**Goal**: Establish whether real budget exists and is in range. Score **T (Ticket)**.

**Never ask "what is your budget?" directly.** Use anchoring and indirect probing.

#### Step 1: Establish prior spend
> "Have you worked with external consultants or technology partners before on
> projects like this?"

> "What was the scale of those engagements — roughly?"

*(If yes, this confirms they understand the consulting investment model.)*

#### Step 2: Anchor with a range
> "For context — engagements at the scope you are describing typically run in
> the range of [low end] to [high end], depending on team size and duration.
> Is that directionally consistent with what you have in mind?"

Use these reference ranges:
- Staff augmentation / advisory: $50K-$150K
- Standard project (3-5 people, 2-4 months): $150K-$400K
- Large engagement (6-10 people, 4-6 months): $400K-$800K
- Transformation program: $800K+

**Responses and what they mean**:
- "Yes, that is in the right range" → score T = 4-5, confirm allocation
- "That is higher than I expected" → score T = 2-3, flag Budget risk, do not assume
- "We have not discussed budget yet" → score T = 2, ask next question
- Silence or deflection → score T = 1-2, flag as risk

#### Step 3: Confirm allocation
> "Is the budget for this already approved, or would it require going through
> an approval process?"

> "Is this coming from an existing budget line, or would it need new allocation?"

#### Step 4: Purchase process
> "If we reach an agreement, what does the purchase process look like on your
> side? SOW, procurement, legal review — what should we plan for?"

**Green flags**: Prior consulting spend confirmed. Budget allocated or approval
is a formality. Purchase process known.

**Red flags**: "We need to build a business case." "It depends on other
priorities." "That is much more than I expected." No prior consulting spend.

---

### Phase 5 — Decision Date Extraction (30-35 min)

**Goal**: Extract a specific or approximate decision date. Score **F (Fecha)**.

> "If you decided to move forward with a partner — what would the ideal
> timeline look like from your side? When would you want work to start?"

> "Is there a specific date or event that is driving that timeline?"

> "What happens on your end if you push this out by a quarter?"

> "Is there a budget cycle or planning cycle this needs to fit into?"

**Extraction ladder** — move from soft to specific:
1. "Is there a timeline you are working against?"
2. "When would you ideally want to have something in place?"
3. "Is that tied to a specific event, launch, or deadline?"
4. "What is the date of that event?"

**Scoring the response**:
- F = 5: Specific date given, tied to external event or hard deadline
- F = 4: "Within this quarter" — clear and near-term
- F = 3: "Next 2-3 quarters" — imprecise but directional
- F = 2: "Next fiscal year" — vague, low urgency
- F = 1: "No particular timeline" — not ready to act

**If the date is far or vague**:
> "Given that timeline — what would need to happen between now and then for
> this to stay a priority? What could push it out further?"

---

### Phase 6 — Closing the Meeting (35-40 min)

**Goal**: Leave with a concrete next step or execute a professional cut.

#### If the meeting went well (P.U.D.T.F score >= 22)

> "Based on everything we have covered today, I think there is a real
> conversation to have here. The next logical step for us would be a deeper
> discovery session where we would spend 60 minutes going into [specific area]
> in detail — so we can give you a much more precise picture of what an
> engagement would look like."

> "I would want to include [decision maker role] in that conversation if
> possible. Can we schedule that?"

> "Before we close — is there anything I should have asked that I did not? Any
> concern on your side that we have not addressed?"

#### If there is a specific missing element (score 18-21, borderline)

> "I want to be transparent: there are a couple of areas where I need more
> information before I can say clearly that we are the right fit. Specifically
> [budget clarity / access to [role]]. If we can close those gaps, I think this
> could be a strong match. Would you be open to a follow-up call to address
> those specifically?"

#### If the score is below the cut (P.U.D.T.F < 22) — execute Professional Cut

See Professional Cut Protocol below.

## Professional Cut Protocol

The professional cut is how we disengage gracefully when an opportunity does
not meet the qualification threshold. It protects the prospect's time, preserves
the relationship, and keeps our pipeline clean.

**When to execute**:
- P.U.D.T.F total < 22 after the qualification meeting
- Any single dimension is 1 (hard blocker: no budget, no decision maker access,
  no real problem)
- After probing, urgency score (1-10) is 1-3 with no compelling event

**Principles**:
- Be honest, not harsh
- Give a specific reason — vague rejections feel dismissive
- Leave a door open — timing changes, and the prospect may refer others
- Never ghost — a direct cut is more respectful than silence

---

### Script 1 — No Budget / Not the Right Time

Use when: T (Ticket) = 1-2 or U (Urgencia) = 1-2.

> "I want to be transparent with you, because I think that is more useful than
> keeping a process alive artificially. Based on our conversation today, it
> sounds like [the budget has not been secured / this initiative is not yet a
> priority at the executive level / the timing is not right this quarter]. That
> means we would not be set up to do good work together right now — and I
> do not want to waste your time going further."

> "That does not mean this is dead. If [a budget gets allocated / this becomes
> a priority / the timeline shifts], I would genuinely like to reconnect. I will
> send you a brief note summarizing what we discussed so you have it for
> reference. Would it be okay to follow up in [90 days / next quarter]?"

---

### Script 2 — No Decision Maker Access

Use when: D (Decisor) = 1-2 and prospect resists facilitating access.

> "I have a lot of respect for your time, so I want to be direct. For us to
> move this forward responsibly, we need to have a conversation with the person
> who can actually approve an investment of this size. Without that, I risk
> building something that never gets approved — and that is not fair to either
> of us."

> "I am not trying to go around you. What I am saying is: for this to have a
> real chance of succeeding, that conversation needs to happen at some point.
> If that is not possible right now, I think the honest answer is that we
> should pause until the conditions are right."

> "Would it be helpful if I drafted a brief summary you could share internally
> to build the case for that conversation?"

---

### Script 3 — Problem is Not Real or Not Urgent Enough

Use when: P (Problema) = 1-2 or U = 1-2 with no prospect for change.

> "I appreciate you walking me through the situation. Honestly, based on what
> you described, I am not sure an external engagement is the right solution for
> where you are right now. The problems you are describing seem manageable
> with your current team, and I would rather tell you that than propose
> something you do not genuinely need."

> "If things change — if the scale of the problem grows or the timeline
> accelerates — I would be glad to revisit this. In the meantime, if there is
> anything I can point you toward [a resource, a tool, a framework], I am happy
> to do that. No strings attached."

---

### Script 4 — Catch-All (Borderline / Multiple Weak Signals)

Use when: Score 16-21, multiple dimensions at 2, no single clear path forward.

> "Let me be candid with you. Based on our conversation today, I am not
> confident that moving to the next step right now would be the best use of
> your time or ours. There are a few areas — [budget clarity, access to
> [role], timeline definition] — where we do not yet have enough signal to
> move responsibly."

> "I would rather pause here and come back when those elements are clearer,
> than rush into a discovery process that does not lead anywhere. Is there a
> point in the next [60-90 days] when those could be better defined?"

---

### After the Professional Cut — Follow-Up Email Template

Send within 24 hours. Keep it brief, warm, and specific.

```
Subject: Following up on our conversation — [Company Name]

Hi [Name],

Thank you for the time today. I enjoyed the conversation and I have a lot of
respect for what you are working on.

As I mentioned, based on where things stand [the timing / the budget
process / the priority level], I do not think now is the right moment to
move forward. That may change, and if it does, I would be glad to reconnect.

Key things I noted from our conversation:
- [Core problem or initiative they described]
- [Timeline or trigger that might change things]

I will plan to follow up in [date / timeframe] unless you reach out sooner.
If there is anything useful I can share in the meantime, let me know.

Best,
[Name]
```

## Red Flags During Qualification

The following signals should increase scrutiny and may trigger a Professional Cut:

1. **Urgency score 1-3** with no compelling event on the horizon.
2. **Prospect cannot name who approves** the budget after direct questioning.
3. **"We need to build a business case"** — budget not yet secured, internal champion is weak.
4. **Scope described in buzzwords only** ("AI transformation," "data-driven culture") with no specific problem after probing.
5. **The meeting was scheduled by procurement or vendor management** — signals a pricing exercise, not a genuine evaluation.
6. **Prospect compares our engagement to SaaS pricing** — misunderstanding of consulting model.
7. **Decision date is "whenever" or "no rush"** — no external driver.
8. **Contact is filling a research or vendor-list task** — no personal stake in the outcome.
9. **Organizational instability mentioned** (recent layoffs, leadership change, M&A) — budget and priorities likely in flux.
10. **Resistance to the mutual-evaluation framing** — signals a power dynamic that will make the sale difficult.

---

## Green Flags During Qualification

Signals that an opportunity is worth investing in:

1. **Urgency score 7-10** with a specific event or deadline named.
2. **Champion can name the economic buyer** and is willing to make the introduction.
3. **Prior consulting spend confirmed** — they understand the investment model.
4. **Problem is quantified** in money, time, or risk — not just described generically.
5. **Decision process explained clearly** — they have done this before.
6. **Budget is allocated or approval is a near formality**.
7. **Decision date is specific or tied to a real event**.
8. **Prospect did pre-work** — came prepared with context, diagrams, or prior analyses.
9. **Multiple stakeholders mentioned proactively** — organizational buy-in exists.
10. **"We tried this internally and it did not work"** — signals they value external expertise.

---

## Transition to Branch B Script

Use when the prospect qualifies (P.U.D.T.F >= 22, BANTTD verdict: Pursue) but
scope uncertainty is high — qualifying for Branch B (Discovery Service Proposal).

> "Based on everything we have discussed today, I am confident there is a
> real problem here and that we have the right capabilities to help. I also
> want to be honest: the scope is complex enough that I would be doing you
> a disservice if I gave you a fixed-price proposal without first doing
> a proper technical and strategic assessment."

> "What I would recommend is that we start with a structured Discovery
> engagement — typically [2-4] weeks — where we go deep on [specific areas].
> At the end, you get a clear implementation roadmap, a risk assessment, and
> a precise proposal based on actual findings rather than assumptions."

> "The Discovery itself is a paid, fixed-price engagement. It is not a free
> scoping exercise — it is a deliverable in its own right. Most clients find
> that it either validates their thinking and sets up a stronger implementation,
> or it surfaces things that save them from a much more expensive mistake."

> "Does that approach make sense for where you are right now?"

**If they ask about the cost of Discovery**:
> "Discovery engagements at this scope typically run [range]. We can discuss
> the exact scope and deliverables in our next conversation — I want to make
> sure it is sized right for your situation, not just a standard package."

**If they push for a direct proposal instead**:
> "I can do that — but I want to flag the risk: at this level of complexity,
> any estimate I give you today has an uncertainty range of +/- 30% or more.
> That is a wide range and can cause friction later. The Discovery narrows that
> to +/- 15-20%, which gives both of us a much more solid basis. Ultimately
> it is your call — I just want you to have the full picture."
