## Upsell Playbook

### Principles

- Build on trust earned during current delivery — never cold-pitch an existing client.
- Position upsell as continuity, not a new sale: "Phase 2" is easier to approve than "New Project."
- Anchor proposals to outcomes already delivered — show the delta between current state and full potential.

### Common Upsell Patterns

| Pattern | Trigger | Proposal Approach |
|---|---|---|
| Next Phase | Current phase completing successfully | "Phase 2" proposal building on delivered outcomes |
| Deeper Engagement | Client asks for more scope mid-project | Change request → expanded SOW |
| Extended Support | Project closing, client lacks internal capacity | Retainer or managed-service proposal |
| New Workstream | Adjacent need surfaced during delivery | Lightweight assessment → scoped engagement |
| Scale-Up | Pilot succeeded, client wants to roll out wider | Scale proposal with reduced per-unit cost |

### Next-Phase Proposal Template (Lighter Than Full Proposal)

Use this structure for follow-on engagements where the relationship is established:

```markdown
# [Client Name] — Phase [N] Proposal

## Context & Continuity
- Summarize Phase [N-1] outcomes (reference delivered artifacts).
- State why Phase [N] is the natural next step.

## Proposed Scope
- List workstreams with brief descriptions.
- Explicitly state what is out of scope.

## Approach
- Methodology (reference approach used in prior phase if consistent).
- Team composition (highlight returning team members for continuity).

## Timeline & Investment
- Duration estimate.
- Fee structure (fixed, T&M, or blended).
- Payment milestones.

## Assumptions & Dependencies
- Client responsibilities.
- Access requirements.
- Decisions needed before kickoff.

## Next Steps
- Review meeting date.
- Approval process.
- Proposed start date.
```

### Upsell Conversation Starters

- "Based on what we delivered in Phase 1, there are three areas where you could unlock additional value…"
- "Your team mentioned [specific pain point] during delivery — we have a proven approach for that."
- "The platform we built can do significantly more with [specific enhancement] — want us to scope it?"

## Cross-sell Playbook

### Service Line Adjacency Map

Identify cross-sell opportunities by mapping service line adjacencies:

```
Software ──→ Data     "You built the app — now instrument and analyze its data."
Software ──→ AI       "Add intelligent features to your software product."
Software ──→ Cloud    "Optimize your infrastructure for scale and cost."
Data     ──→ AI       "You have the data — now build models on it."
Data     ──→ Software "Surface your data insights through a custom application."
Data     ──→ Cloud    "Modernize your data infrastructure in the cloud."
AI       ──→ Software "Productionize your models into user-facing applications."
AI       ──→ Data     "Improve your data quality and pipelines to feed better models."
AI       ──→ Cloud    "Scale your ML infrastructure for training and inference."
Cloud    ──→ Any      "Modernize [any workload] with cloud-native architecture."
```

### Cross-sell Conversation Starters

| Transition | Starter |
|---|---|
| Software → Data | "Now that the application is live, how are you tracking user behavior and business KPIs?" |
| Software → AI | "Have you considered adding predictive features? We could build on the data your app already generates." |
| Data → AI | "You've got a solid data foundation — the next step is turning that into predictive models." |
| Data → Software | "Your analytics team is doing great work — would a self-service dashboard help scale their impact?" |
| AI → Software | "Your models are performing well in notebooks — let's get them into production where users can benefit." |
| Any → Cloud | "Your infrastructure costs are growing linearly — a cloud optimization engagement could bend that curve." |

### Mini-Discovery Guide for Cross-sell

When cross-selling, leverage the existing relationship to run a shorter discovery:

1. **Review existing artifacts**: Read project-state, lessons-learned, and closure-report for mentions of adjacent needs.
2. **Identify the internal champion**: Find the person on the client side most likely to sponsor the new workstream.
3. **Conduct a 60-minute discovery session** (not a multi-day affair):
   - Current pain in the adjacent area (15 min).
   - What they've tried so far (10 min).
   - What success looks like (10 min).
   - Constraints and timeline (10 min).
   - Next steps (15 min).
4. **Produce a 2-page opportunity brief** (not a full proposal):
   - Problem summary.
   - Proposed approach (high level).
   - Estimated effort and investment range.
   - Why us (reference existing relationship and delivered outcomes).
5. **Get verbal alignment** before investing in a full proposal.

## Advocacy Playbook

### Case Study Creation Process

#### Step 1: Identify Candidates
Select projects that meet at least three of these criteria:
- Delivered on time and within budget.
- Measurable business impact (quantified metrics).
- Client is willing to be named (or anonymized version is still compelling).
- Showcases a strategic service line or industry vertical.
- Interesting technical challenge or methodology.

#### Step 2: Client Interview Guide
Conduct a 30–45 minute interview with the client sponsor. Questions:

1. "What was the business challenge that led you to engage us?"
2. "What had you tried before, and why didn't it work?"
3. "What were your initial concerns about this engagement?"
4. "How would you describe our approach and working style?"
5. "What specific results have you seen since go-live?"
6. "Can you quantify the impact — time saved, revenue gained, cost reduced?"
7. "Would you recommend us to a peer? What would you say?"
8. "Is there a quote we can attribute to you for the case study?"

#### Step 3: Draft Using STAR Framework

```markdown
# Case Study: [Title — Outcome-Oriented]

## Situation
[2–3 paragraphs: client context, industry, challenge, business impact of the problem]

## Task
[1–2 paragraphs: what we were engaged to do, scope, objectives]

## Action
[2–3 paragraphs: methodology, approach, team, key decisions, technologies used]

## Result
[2–3 paragraphs: quantified outcomes, metrics, ROI, timeline]

---
**Client**: [Name or "Leading [Industry] Company"]
**Industry**: [Industry]
**Service Line**: [Software / Data / AI / Cloud]
**Duration**: [X months]
**Team Size**: [X people]
**Technologies**: [List]

> "[Client quote]" — [Name, Title, Company]
```

#### Step 4: Approval Workflow
1. Share draft with client sponsor for factual review.
2. Incorporate feedback.
3. Get written approval (email is sufficient) for external use.
4. Produce two versions:
   - **Detailed** (2–3 pages): For sales conversations and proposals.
   - **Summary** (1 paragraph + key metrics): For website and marketing materials.

### Referral Program

#### When to Ask for Referrals
- After a successful project closure (within 2 weeks of sign-off).
- After receiving positive feedback or NPS score ≥ 9.
- After a QBR where the client expressed high satisfaction.
- Never during an active delivery issue.

#### How to Ask
- Be specific: "Do you know anyone at [specific company or in specific role] who faces similar challenges?"
- Make it easy: "I'd be happy to draft an intro email for you to forward."
- Offer reciprocity: "We'd love to feature your success in our materials — would that be helpful for your team's visibility too?"

#### Follow-up
- Thank the referrer regardless of outcome.
- Keep the referrer informed of progress (without breaching confidentiality).
- Track referral-to-close conversion rate.

### Reference Program

- Maintain a list of 5–10 active client references across industries and service lines.
- Rotate references to avoid overloading any single client.
- Brief the reference before each call: who they'll speak with, what the prospect cares about.
- Send a thank-you after each reference call.
- Review the reference list quarterly — remove disengaged contacts, add recent happy clients.

### Speaking & Events

- Co-present at conferences with clients: positions both parties as thought leaders.
- Invite clients to company events, webinars, or roundtables.
- Publish joint blog posts or whitepapers.
- Nominate clients for industry awards (with their permission).

## Quarterly Business Review (QBR) Guide

### Purpose
Surface expansion opportunities naturally while demonstrating ongoing value. A QBR is a relationship tool, not a sales pitch.

### Agenda Template (60–90 Minutes)

```markdown
# Quarterly Business Review — [Client Name] — [Quarter]

## 1. Delivery Review (20 min)
- Active project status and key milestones.
- Metrics and outcomes delivered this quarter.
- Issues resolved and lessons learned.

## 2. Value Delivered (15 min)
- Cumulative impact since engagement start.
- ROI metrics (if measurable).
- Client feedback and satisfaction trends.

## 3. Strategic Alignment (15 min)
- Client's evolving priorities and challenges.
- Industry trends affecting the client.
- How current work maps to client's strategic goals.

## 4. Forward Look (15 min)
- Upcoming project phases or milestones.
- Areas where we see additional opportunity (present as insights, not pitches).
- New capabilities or offerings relevant to the client.

## 5. Open Discussion (10 min)
- Client questions and concerns.
- Relationship health check.
- Action items and next steps.
```

### Metrics to Present
- Project delivery metrics (on-time, on-budget, quality).
- Business impact metrics (revenue, cost savings, efficiency gains).
- Team utilization and knowledge transfer progress.
- Satisfaction scores or feedback trends.

### How to Surface Expansion Without Being Salesy
- Frame as insight: "Based on our work this quarter, we noticed [observation] — this could be an opportunity for [outcome]."
- Frame as industry context: "We're seeing similar clients invest in [area] — given your [situation], this might be relevant."
- Frame as risk mitigation: "One area we flagged during delivery is [gap] — addressing it proactively could prevent [risk]."
- Let the client pull: Present the insight, then listen. If they lean in, offer to scope it. If they don't, move on.

## Churn Prevention

### Warning Signs of Disengagement

| Signal | Severity | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Champion stops attending meetings | High | Loss of internal advocacy |
| Delayed responses to emails/proposals | Medium | Shifting priorities or dissatisfaction |
| "Let's revisit next quarter" responses | Medium | Budget pressure or lost interest |
| New vendor mentioned in conversations | High | Competitive threat |
| Reduction in project scope or budget | High | Budget cuts or trust erosion |
| Key contact leaves the organization | High | Loss of relationship continuity |
| Client skips or cancels QBR | Medium | Deprioritization of the relationship |
| Invoice disputes or payment delays | Medium | Financial stress or dissatisfaction |

### Proactive Measures

1. **Maintain multi-threaded relationships**: Never depend on a single champion. Build connections at 3+ levels (exec, management, practitioner).
2. **Deliver consistent value signals**: Share industry insights, benchmarking data, or relevant research between engagements.
3. **Monitor satisfaction continuously**: Do not wait for formal surveys. Ask informally during delivery.
4. **Create switching costs** (ethically): Deep integration, knowledge transfer, co-developed IP — make the relationship sticky through value.
5. **Stay visible between engagements**: Invite to events, share content, schedule informal check-ins.

### Recovery Playbook

When warning signs are detected:

1. **Diagnose** (Week 1): Have an honest conversation with the champion. Ask directly: "Is there anything we should be doing differently?"
2. **Escalate internally** (Week 1): Brief account leadership. Assign a senior relationship owner if one is not already engaged.
3. **Action plan** (Week 2): Based on diagnosis, create a concrete recovery plan:
   - Delivery issue → Fix it immediately and communicate the fix.
   - Relationship issue → Schedule face-to-face meeting with senior leadership.
   - Competitive threat → Demonstrate differentiated value; do not badmouth competitors.
   - Budget issue → Offer flexible engagement models (smaller scope, different pricing).
4. **Execute and follow up** (Weeks 3–4): Implement the plan and check in weekly until the situation stabilizes.
5. **Post-mortem** (Week 6): Document what happened and why. Feed into lessons learned for future account management.

## Revenue Metrics

Track these metrics to measure account growth effectiveness:

| Metric | Definition | Target |
|---|---|---|
| **Account Growth Rate** | YoY revenue growth per account | ≥ 15% for strategic accounts |
| **Net Revenue Retention (NRR)** | (Revenue from existing accounts this period) / (Revenue from same accounts last period) | ≥ 110% |
| **Expansion Rate** | Revenue from upsell + cross-sell / Total revenue | ≥ 30% of new bookings |
| **Advocacy Conversion Rate** | Case studies + referrals generated / Eligible completed projects | ≥ 40% |
| **Cross-sell Penetration** | Accounts using ≥ 2 service lines / Total active accounts | ≥ 25% |
| **QBR Completion Rate** | QBRs conducted / QBRs scheduled | 100% for strategic accounts |
| **Time to Expand** | Average days from project close to next signed SOW | ≤ 90 days |
| **Champion Coverage** | Accounts with ≥ 2 active champions / Total accounts | ≥ 60% |

### How to Use These Metrics

- Review monthly at leadership level.
- Include NRR and expansion rate in board reporting.
- Use time-to-expand as a leading indicator — if it's growing, the expansion process is slowing.
- Advocacy conversion rate below target signals missed opportunities at project closure.
- Cross-sell penetration below target signals service line silos — address through account planning.
