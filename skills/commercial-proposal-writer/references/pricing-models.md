## Time & Materials (T&M)

### Structure
- Client pays for actual hours worked × agreed hourly/daily rate
- Monthly invoicing based on timesheets
- No fixed total — scope determines total cost

### When to Use
- Scope is uncertain or evolving (common in early phases)
- Advisory/strategic work where deliverables are fluid
- Long-term engagements with ongoing needs
- Client wants maximum flexibility and control

### Pricing Levers
- **Rate tiers by seniority**: Senior $200-250/hr, Mid $140-180/hr, Junior $80-120/hr
- **Blended rate**: Single weighted average rate for team simplicity
- **Rate cap**: Maximum monthly spend to give client budget confidence
- **Volume discount**: Reduced rate for commitments over X hours/month

### Contract Terms
- Minimum commitment: typically 1-3 months
- Notice period: typically 2-4 weeks
- Rate adjustment: annually or at renewal
- Timesheet approval: weekly or bi-weekly

## Fixed Price

### Structure
- Agreed total price for defined scope and deliverables
- Payments tied to milestones/deliverables
- Scope changes handled through change orders

### When to Use
- Scope is well-defined and stable
- Client needs budget certainty
- Short engagements (< 3 months)
- Deliverables are clearly measurable

### Pricing Approach
1. Estimate effort (hours × rate)
2. Add risk buffer: 15-25% depending on uncertainty
3. Round to a clean number
4. Structure milestone payments

### Risk Mitigation
- Crystal-clear scope definition (in/out)
- Explicit change order process
- Assumptions listed and acceptance criteria defined
- "Not to exceed" clauses for client-caused delays

## Outcome-Based

### Structure
- Fee tied to measurable business outcomes
- Base fee + success fee (performance bonus)
- Outcomes must be measurable and attributable

### When to Use
- Clear, measurable business metrics (revenue, cost reduction, performance improvement)
- Both parties agree on measurement methodology
- Consulting firm is confident in delivering results
- Long-term relationship where outcomes can be measured

### Structure Examples
- Base fee (70%) + performance bonus (30%) tied to KPIs
- Reduced rate with gain-sharing (X% of documented savings)
- Success fee only (high risk, used for proven relationships)

### Requirements
- Baseline measurement before engagement
- Agreed measurement methodology
- Measurement period defined (often extends beyond engagement)
- Attribution methodology (how to credit improvements to consulting work)

## Retainer

### Structure
- Fixed monthly fee for agreed capacity/availability
- Typically X hours/month or X days/month
- Unused hours may or may not roll over

### When to Use
- Ongoing advisory needs (fractional CTO, architecture advisor)
- Continuous support and improvement
- Client values consistent availability
- Relationship-based, long-term engagement

### Terms
- Minimum commitment: 3-6 months
- Hours: typically 20-80 hours/month
- Rollover: up to X% of unused hours (e.g., 25%)
- Overage: billed at agreed overage rate (typically premium)
- Review: quarterly business reviews to assess value

## Blended / Hybrid

### Structure
- Different pricing models for different phases or components
- Most common: T&M for discovery/assessment + Fixed for delivery

### Common Combinations
1. **T&M Discovery → Fixed Delivery**: Reduce risk by scoping in T&M, then fixing price for well-understood work
2. **Fixed Base → T&M Enhancements**: Core deliverable at fixed price, additional requests at T&M
3. **Retainer → Project**: Advisory retainer leading to specific project engagements
4. **Fixed + Outcome**: Fixed base for delivery + bonus for exceeding performance targets

### Advantages
- Distributes risk appropriately by engagement phase
- Gives client budget certainty where possible
- Maintains flexibility where needed
- Common and well-understood by procurement

## Discount Strategy

### When to Offer Discounts
- Multi-phase commitment (5-10% for full program)
- Volume commitment (>X hours/month)
- Strategic account (long-term relationship value)
- Competitive pressure (match or beat, with justification)

### How to Structure
- Never discount the rate directly — use "program discount" or "volume adjustment"
- Package discounts as "included value" rather than price reduction
- Offer scope expansion at same price rather than pure price cuts
- Quid pro quo: discount in exchange for case study rights, reference, or longer commitment

### What to Never Discount
- Rush/emergency work
- Change orders (these are new scope)
- Travel and expenses (bill at cost)
- Specialized expertise (premium rates are earned)

## Pricing Model Decision Matrix

Use this matrix to select the right model based on engagement characteristics:

| Factor | T&M | Fixed | Outcome | Retainer | Hybrid |
|--------|-----|-------|---------|----------|--------|
| Scope clarity | Low | High | Medium | Low | Mixed |
| Client risk tolerance | High | Low | Medium | Low | Medium |
| Engagement length | Any | Short (<3mo) | Long (>6mo) | Ongoing | Multi-phase |
| Relationship stage | Any | Established | Deep trust | Long-term | Growing |
| Budget certainty need | Low | High | Medium | High | Medium |
| Our confidence in scope | Low | High | High | N/A | Varies |

**Decision flow**:
1. Is scope well-defined? → Yes: Consider Fixed. No: Continue.
2. Are outcomes measurable and attributable? → Yes: Consider Outcome-Based. No: Continue.
3. Is this ongoing advisory/support? → Yes: Consider Retainer. No: Continue.
4. Is this multi-phase with varying scope clarity? → Yes: Consider Hybrid. No: Default to T&M.

## Rate Card Structure

### Building a Rate Card
Define rate tiers by seniority level. Each tier reflects experience, impact, and market rates.

| Tier | Title Examples | Typical Range (USD/hr) | Role in Engagement |
|------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Principal** | Partner, VP, Principal Consultant | $250-400 | Strategic guidance, executive relationships, quality assurance |
| **Senior** | Senior Consultant, Tech Lead, Architect | $180-280 | Technical leadership, solution design, complex problem-solving |
| **Mid-Level** | Consultant, Engineer, Analyst | $120-200 | Core delivery, implementation, analysis |
| **Junior** | Associate, Junior Consultant | $80-140 | Execution support, documentation, testing |

### Calculating Blended Rates
Blended rate = weighted average based on team composition and allocation.

**Formula**: Blended Rate = Σ (Rate_i × Allocation_%_i) / Σ (Allocation_%_i)

**Example**:
- 1 Senior Architect @ $220/hr, 50% allocation
- 2 Mid-Level Engineers @ $150/hr, 100% allocation each
- 1 Junior Analyst @ $100/hr, 50% allocation

Blended = (220×0.5 + 150×1.0 + 150×1.0 + 100×0.5) / (0.5 + 1.0 + 1.0 + 0.5) = $160/hr × 3.0 FTE-equivalent = 460 / 3.0 = ~$153/hr

### Rate Card Presentation
- Present the blended rate to simplify client conversations
- Keep the detailed rate card available for T&M engagements where seniority mix varies
- Update rates annually; communicate increases 60 days in advance
- Consider geography-adjusted rates for distributed teams

## ROI / Business Case Template

### Structure
Present ROI in the proposal's Expected Outcomes section. Use this framework:

```
### ROI Analysis

**Current Cost of Problem** (annual)
- Direct cost 1: $X (e.g., manual process labor: 4 FTEs × $Y = $Z)
- Direct cost 2: $X (e.g., system downtime: N hours × $Y revenue/hour)
- Opportunity cost: $X (e.g., delayed product launches: N releases × $Y revenue)
- Risk cost: $X (e.g., compliance exposure: probability × impact)
- **Total Annual Cost of Problem**: $X

**Engagement Investment**
- Consulting fees: $X
- Client internal effort: $X (estimated)
- Technology/licensing: $X (if applicable)
- **Total Investment**: $X

**Expected Annual Benefit** (post-implementation)
- Benefit 1: $X (e.g., labor savings from automation)
- Benefit 2: $X (e.g., revenue acceleration)
- Benefit 3: $X (e.g., risk reduction)
- **Total Annual Benefit**: $X

**ROI Summary**
- Payback period: X months
- First-year ROI: (Annual Benefit - Investment) / Investment × 100 = X%
- 3-year ROI: ((Annual Benefit × 3) - Investment) / Investment × 100 = X%
```

### Guidelines
- Be conservative — understate benefits, overstate costs. Credibility matters more than impressive numbers.
- Use the client's own data from discovery wherever possible.
- Distinguish "hard" savings (headcount, license reduction) from "soft" savings (productivity, risk).
- If ROI cannot be quantified, present qualitative value: strategic positioning, competitive advantage, risk mitigation.
- Always state assumptions explicitly.

## Common Pricing Objections & Responses

### "Your rates are too high"
- Reframe to total value: "Compare the total engagement cost against the $X annual cost of the problem we're solving. The question isn't whether $Y is expensive — it's whether $Y is worth $Z in return."
- Offer scope adjustment, not rate reduction: "We can reduce the scope to fit the budget — which phases are most critical to start with?"
- Distinguish rate from cost: "A lower rate with longer delivery timeline or higher rework rate often costs more in total."

### "Competitor X quoted 30% less"
- Avoid rate wars: "We respect their pricing. Let me help you compare on total value: scope coverage, team seniority, methodology, and risk allocation."
- Highlight hidden costs: "Confirm what's included: are travel, project management, knowledge transfer, and documentation in their scope?"
- Offer a pilot: "Start with a small Phase 0 so you can evaluate our delivery quality directly before committing to the full program."

### "We need to reduce budget by 20%"
- Never discount without getting something back: "We can reduce by adjusting scope (remove Phase X), extending timeline (part-time team), or shifting risk (move from Fixed to T&M)."
- Offer value adds: "Rather than reducing price, we can add [training, documentation, extended support] at the same investment."
- Multi-phase commitment: "If you commit to Phases 1-3, we can offer a 5-10% program discount."

### "Can you do it for a fixed price?"
- Assess scope clarity: "Fixed price works well when scope is well-defined. Based on our discovery, [specific areas] still have uncertainty. We recommend T&M for Phase 0 to firm up scope, then we'll provide a confident fixed price for delivery."
- Include change order process: "Yes, for a fixed price we'll need to define scope precisely and include a change order process for anything outside that scope."

### "Why should we pay for your learning curve?"
- Demonstrate relevant experience: "Our team has delivered X similar engagements. The ramp-up is not learning the technology — it's learning your specific business context, which any team would need."
- Highlight accelerators: "Our methodology and reusable assets from similar projects typically save 20-30% compared to starting from scratch."

## Payment Terms Options

### Common Structures

| Structure | Description | Best For |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Monthly arrears** | Invoice at month-end for hours worked | T&M engagements |
| **Milestone-based** | Invoice on deliverable completion | Fixed-price engagements |
| **Upfront + milestones** | 20-30% on SOW execution, rest on milestones | Fixed-price, new client relationships |
| **Progressive** | 30/30/30/10 split across engagement phases | Multi-phase programs |
| **Retainer prepay** | Monthly fee invoiced in advance | Retainer engagements |

### Payment Timeline
- Net 15: For established clients with good payment history
- Net 30: Standard terms for most engagements
- Net 45-60: Large enterprise / procurement-driven (avoid if possible)
- Immediate: For small engagements or high-risk clients

### Late Payment
- Include a late payment clause: typically 1.5% per month on overdue amounts
- Reserve the right to pause work if invoices are 30+ days overdue
- For new clients, request upfront payment or shorter payment terms until trust is established

## Margin Considerations

### Target Margins
- **Healthy engagement**: 40-60% gross margin (revenue minus direct delivery cost)
- **Minimum acceptable**: 25-30% gross margin (below this, evaluate strategic value)
- **Premium engagements**: 60-70% (specialized expertise, outcome-based with high upside)

### Margin Calculation
- **Direct cost**: Team members' fully-loaded cost (salary + benefits + overhead) × hours
- **Gross margin**: (Revenue - Direct Cost) / Revenue × 100
- **Example**: Billing $150/hr for a consultant costing $70/hr fully-loaded = ($150-$70)/$150 = 53% gross margin

### When to Accept Lower Margins
- Strategic account with high future potential (document the strategy)
- Reference client that unlocks a new vertical or capability
- Team utilization: better to bill at low margin than have idle team
- Competitive displacement: winning the account from a competitor has long-term value

### When to Walk Away
- Margin consistently below 20% with no strategic justification
- Client demands rates below fully-loaded cost
- Scope is undefined AND client insists on fixed price AND won't do discovery
- Payment terms create cash flow risk (net 90+, milestone disputes likely)
- Client's procurement process costs more to win than the engagement is worth

### Protecting Margins
- Track actual vs. estimated hours weekly — catch overruns early
- Use change order process rigorously for out-of-scope requests
- Staff with the right seniority mix — don't over-senior or under-senior the team
- Include a contingency buffer (10-20%) in fixed-price estimates
- Review margins quarterly and adjust rate cards accordingly
