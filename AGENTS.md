This is a project for managing AI agents configurations and templates.

## Skills

- **Creation & Validation:** Always use the `skill-creator` tool to create or validate skills.
- **Skill Discovery:** Before creating a new skill, use the `find-skill` tool to search for existing skills within the `skills.sh` registry. These can be reused, used as a reference, or serve as inspiration for new skill creation.
- **Storage:** All skills are stored in the `skills/` folder.
- **Naming Convention:** Each skill must have a name in lowercase with hyphens (kebab-case), for example: `consulting-project-planner`.
- **Documentation:** Each skill must have a description explaining what it does and when to use it. It should include specific keywords that help agents identify relevant tasks.
